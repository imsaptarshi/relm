## ❓ How did I actually use Supabase in Relm

This was my first time using Supabase, though it has been pretty popular among my dev friends I never checked it out, but soon that day one of my friend posted about the Supabase hackathon and hearing about it I was really excited to participate in it and try out Supabase. Let me tell you, Supabase has really broke the roof of awesomeness.

- Firstly I used Supabase for user authentication with email(Magic link) and google auth
- And as planned I used Supabase wholly to structure my database
